# iOS-Bitcoin-App

An iOS Bitcoin app which allows the user to scroll through many different currencies using a picker. When the user picks a 
currency the current Bitcoin price is then converted to whatever currency they choose. This app uses cocopods like JSON, and 
Alamofire. The current Bitcoin price is taken from an API called bitcoinaverage.com. I followed video tutorials from the 
London app brewery through Udemy to create this.
